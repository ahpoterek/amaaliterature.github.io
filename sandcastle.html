        We’re going to the beach, to the playground near the sea.
        To the sandbox near the fountain, beneath the big palm tree.
        The perfect site for best-friend fun, the spot for you and me.
        Here, we’ll build a mighty castle on the playground near the sea.
        <p>
        <b>5</b>
        Let’s fill a bucket with water and pour it on the land.
        To make the sand muddy and damp, to work with it by hand.
        Now pile the sand up in the center—as much as your fingers can.
        To start a mighty castle on the playground made of sand.
        Then make the sand like towers; form walls that stretch up high.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>10</b>
        Add more water now and then; don’t let that sand get dry!
        Our work is good but not quite done; care to give another try?
        This mighty sandy castle has yet to reach the sky!
        Yes, the sun has gotten lower; our shadows have grown gray.
        And the sand is getting dry again—much too dry for play.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>15</b> So let’s skip on home to dinner, looking back once more to say,
        “We built a mighty castle on the playground on this day.”

        <div class="container text-left">
        <p>
        <b>1</b> Foamy waves splash upon the beach. A <u>misshapen</u> pile of wet sand is out of reach of the waves. Plop! A child dumps a bucket of
        sand on the mound and then carves lines into it. After some time the pile of sand looks somewhat like a castle. Holes in the sides of
        the mound look like windows. A tower with flat ledges sticks up on one side, while the wall on the other side has crumbled.
        </p> 
        <p>
        <b>2</b> On many beaches it is common to see children building sandcastles. However, the results of their efforts seem clumsy or
        careless when compared to the magnificent castles found in book illustrations and fairy tales. But building a sandcastle that looks as
        good as a castle in a drawing is not easy.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>3</b>Some people think that all that is needed to build a sandy masterpiece is a plastic bucket and a shovel. But building an
        expert sandcastle really requires patience and attention to detail, as well as the proper tools. Some sandcastle builders are actually
        professional sand sculptors. They have mastered their art through practicing and learning from other sand sculptors. The tricks these
        sculptors know can help anyone build a better sandcastle.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>4</b> A strong sandcastle needs sand that is just the right wetness. Dry sand will crumble. Sand that is too wet will be soggy. Some
        experts say it is best to fill a bucket with water and then add sand to it. They know the sand is just right when it can be molded by
        hand and keep a shape. To start a sandcastle, expert builders pile sand on the ground. They don’t worry about the shape when
        getting started, and neither should you. Just make sure to have enough sand to complete the project.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>5</b>For beginners it may be easier to pack sand into a bucket and tip the bucket over onto the ground. Some experts use wooden
        beams to make walls to hold the sand together and then pack the sand until it becomes firm. Once the sand is firm enough, they
        remove the wooden beams, leaving a block of sand. Having compact sand is a really important step in the process of making a
        great sandcastle. Even experts agree that no matter what you are making, big or small, it is vital to pack the sand tightly.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>6</b>It’s important to get the main part of the castle just right. If a tall, round tower is the goal, the bottom should be wide and well
        packed and have a smooth surface. Tall towers will begin to fall if the base is too small.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>7</b>After the sandcastle is shaped, it is time to carve the details. Expert sculptors use all kinds of tools to carve. Garden shovels can be used to shape the walls. 
        Pointed tools are good for making smaller details, such as stairs. Some experts use kitchen tools, such as rubber spatulas. Others prefer small artists’ tools, such as
        paint knives. Fun tools for kids include Popsicle sticks and toothpicks.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>8</b>When building sandcastles, even the best sculptors make mistakes. But there’s no need to worry. A paintbrush can act like
        an eraser. It can smooth out areas so that an artist can add just the right details. If the brush removes too much sand, the artist simply adds more.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>9</b> As experts carve, the sand may start to dry out. Some experts keep a spray bottle full of water nearby to keep the sand damp so
        it won’t crumble. Then when they finish carving, they might add ornaments to their creation. Seashells and seaweed are sometimes used to decorate walls and towers.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>10</b>Building a sandcastle is a great way to spend time at the beach. By following this advice from experts, you, too, can make a
        sandcastle that looks like it belongs in a fairy tale!
