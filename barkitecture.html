        There’s a new house in the neighborhood. Although smaller than the other houses, this new shelter is definitely the most interesting. A sunroof allows the sun to warm 
        the house during the winter months. A spout collects fresh rainwater. A decorative awning hangs over the door, providing protection during rainy weather.
        Who is the proud occupant of this house? A dog! In his new Barkitecture house, he’s the luckiest pup on the block. 
        <p>
        <b>2</b>
        The process of designing houses for dogs is sometimes called Barkitecture. This term comes from a book by Fred Albert titled Barkitecture, which shows some of the most 
        amazing doghouses ever built. Special doghouses are now built and sold at Barkitecture events to raise money for animals in need. Architects (people who design buildings) 
        plan and build many of these doghouses. People who want doghouses bid on the ones they like best. The person who makes the highest offer for a certain
        doghouse gets to take it home.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>3</b>
        The money collected during Barkitecture events is given to organizations that provide animals with food, shelter, or medical care. The money also helps animals in need by 
        paying for pet adoptions and teaching families how to take care of pets.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>4</b> 
        The features of Barkitecture doghouses are not often found on typical doghouses. Some Barkitecture doghouses are designed to resemble log cabins or even famous buildings.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>5</b>
         Any type of building material can be used to make a doghouse for such an event. Builders choose materials according to whether the doghouse will be used indoors or
        outdoors. Some people use recycled materials to build doghouses. The only rule is that the doghouses must be practical. For example, a house made completely of chew bones 
        might be cute—but it might be eaten rather than lived in.
        </p> 
        <p>
        <b>6</b> 
        Barkitecture events offer a variety of enjoyable activities. There are areas where dogs and their owners can play. People from pet-adoption organizations set up information 
        booths and distribute helpful materials that explain how to care for dogs. At other booths pet owners can buy treats such as chicken-chipcookies and chicken-liver brownies. 
        Guests are treated to a doggy fashion show featuring pups modeling outfits. And, of course, the dogs can test out the different houses.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>7</b>
        Barkitecture events are becoming very popular. Some of the fancy doghouse designs have been featured in newspapers and on television. The designs can be seen on the Internet, too.
        The imagination an creativity of the people who enter the even are also recognized. Ribbons are awarded in categories such as best in show, people’s choice, kids’ choice, most
        environmentally friendly doghouse, and most unusual doghouse. Next time you hear about a Barkitecture event in your area, you might want to attend. You’ll be amazed at what you 
        see—and your canine friend will enjoy it too!
